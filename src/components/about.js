              <p>
                I'm trained as IT technician. I have been interested in
                programming and new technologies since I was a child. Since
                then, I focus on my continuous development in my programming
                skills, JavaScript and using React library in particular. My
                biggest aim is to improve myself in Back-end. My professional
                goal is to work as a Front-End Developer.
