                <p>Hello, I'm Micha≈Ç and I'm from Silesia.</p>
                <p>
                  I started my adventure
                  with programming many years ago when I went to computer
                  science in a technical school. After a long break, I decided
                  to start everything from the beginning. For 1 year I have been
                  learning independently from online courses, many specialist
                  websites and forums. I spend every day learning at least 4
                  hours to gain experience and knowledge. I am currently
                  focusing on Front End. In the future I would like to broaden
                  my basic knowledge about Back End. My professional goal is to
                  work as a full stack programmer.
